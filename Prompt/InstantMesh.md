We are trying to run this pipeline with InstantMesh. But let me tell you, InstantMesh is a bit of a hard take. Because it requires different environments compared to our settings, causing everything to be broken down and cannot run. I have found a way to run instantmesh using another python environment. Please identify the code that needs to be run that instantmesh environment (python 3.10). Then, suggest me what to do to integrate it fully to our existing pipeline of Any6D.
